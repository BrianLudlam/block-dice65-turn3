# BlockDice65Turn3

A smart contract implementation that, utiliing an existing BlockDice contract, tracks a single dice roll "turn" by a user, specifically for dice games that require five 6-sided dice rolled up to 3 times per turn. The user is able to bank part of the roll during each turn, common to games like Yatzy (Yahtzee.) The contract is intended to be used by dice game contracts.

## Deployment

The BlockDice65Turn3 contract can be deployed on Ethereum mainnet or testnet, side-chain, or compatible chain. Deployment requires address of deployed BlockDice contract.

Run `truffle compile` to compile, `truffle deploy` to deploy (default local chain).

## Testing 

Run `truffle test` for thorough testing.
